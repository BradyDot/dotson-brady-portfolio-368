        <p>I am a senior in college, majoring in communication and design. I am a hobbyist game designer and huge tabletop role-playing game enthusiast. I was born and raised in Spokane, and intend to stay here for a long time. When I graduate later this year, I hope to start working in the design industry, eventually working on professional rpg game projects to help shape my favorite hobby.</p>

      <div class="reflection-text">
        <div class="ref-section">
          <span>Important and Key Experiences</span><p>Two important experiences were learning all the dev tools around week four, and finally understanding how to do this stuff when doing this project.</p></div>
        <div class="ref-section">
          <span>What I Know Now</span><p>Before this class, I knew absolutly nothing about web design. Now, I can sort-of design a website. This is a new skill that I can always keep in my back pocket and learn more about later.</p></div>
      <div class="ref-section">
          <span>Change and Growth</span><p>One big moment for me was learning how useful figma was. It changed the way I think about using design software. I also had to learn in this project how to adapt designs for web with my welcome section. Finally, starting with html helped me to learn function first design.</p></div>
        <div class="ref-section">
          <span>Challenges</span><p>One challenge I've had this quarter was time-managment. I have had a difficult time getting the work for all my classes done, so my grade has suffered a bit. Another challenge was debugging. I have a tendency to spiral when things consistently don't work, so finding errors in code is super hard for me. Finally, I had to learn to think in a different way. It's been super hard to think in terms of code instead of visuals or tangible things.</p></div>
      <div class="ref-section">
            <span>What Worked</span><p>Having the ability to turn in assingments after the fact has been super helpful for reducing stress when falling behind. I've also really enjoyed the freedom to make whatever we want for our projects, as it adds a fun creative process to this. I also really liked the in-class work time as it was really great for getting help.</p></div>
      <div class="ref-section">
            <span>What Didn't Work</span><p>I found the free-code-camps to be a lot of work, mostly when pilled on top of project weeks. This may just be a me-thing, but I felt overwhelmed a few times. There were also a couple times where the instructions for projects seemed to clash slightly with what was discussed in class, which was a little confusing.</p></div>
      <div class="ref-section">
            <span>Connections</span><p>I often talk about this class, sometimes to show off projects, sometimes to vent about debugging. Despite not liking coding very much, I've definitly gained an interest in personalized web-design and have gained a bit of enjoyment. It hasn't connected much with my other courses, although I will probably have a bit of coding next quarter, so I expect it will be super helpful.</p></div>
      <div class="ref-section">
            <span>Final Thoughts</span><p>Coming up with website ideas and itterating on the vidual design was the most fun for me. I found the lectures, millinote resources, and instructer feedback the most helpful. My favortite random fact from this quarter is the existence of the world's worst website. It is an abomination but also hilarious. Finally, I learned that because coding and visual design use two different brain muscles, coding can help to make me better at problem-solving in my day-to-day life.</p></div>
